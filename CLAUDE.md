# Preferred Library

- shadcn
- zod

### Technical Notes / Preferences

- There will be one layout file wrapped with react-native-safe-area-context. Do not use it on other pages.
- Let us use shadcn and I want black and white theme with proper animation. No other colors. Pure black and white theme.
- Always use yarn
- Use axiosInstance with base Url.
- Anything about urls, envs has to be exported from constant/urls.ts constant/envs.ts.
- router push, link, has to use the url form constant/urls.ts (NEVER hardcode the urls on component code)
- NEVER run expo / run yarn dev or yarn build. I will do it myself. Just do the tasks you are told (I will verify and will update yo later)

# Style preference

- use shadcn
- Create specific theme for tailwind and use it across
